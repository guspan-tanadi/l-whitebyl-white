- 👋 Hi, I’m Laura White. I am an experienced full-stack developer specializing in C# .NET on the backend and the modern JavaScript stack (TypeScript) on the frontend. In the last years, I gained experience with the Azure DevOps platform as well as modern client-side frameworks, particularly React.
- 👀 I’m interested everything related to Azure Devops and improving software deployments through CI/CD.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about enterprise architecture in the context of microservices and preparing for the AZ-204 (Azure Developer) certification.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects in C# . NET, Node.js, and React.
