👋 Hi, I’m Laura White. 
- 💻 I am an experienced full-stack software engineer specializing in C# .NET on the backend and the modern JavaScript stack (TypeScript + React) on the frontend. In the last years, I gained experience with the Azure DevOps platform as well as modern client-side frameworks, particularly React.
- 👀 I’m interested everything related to the cloud and improving software deployments through CI/CD in Azure DevOps.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about enterprise architecture in the context of microservices and preparing for the AZ-204 (Azure Developer) certification.
- 💞️ I’m passionate about mentoring junior software engineers and volunteer as a mentor to help answer students' questions in the Zero to Mastery Discord community with 300,000+ students and counting. I created a C# Learning Path, particularly for students in the ZTM community. You can [fork the Github repo](https://github.com/l-white/c-sharp-path) and start learning if you're interested!
